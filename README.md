Clustering What is Clustering? Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique used to group similar data points together into clusters based on their features. The goal is to ensure that data points within a cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters.

# Clustering Algorithm
.K-Means: Use when clusters are spherical and you know the number of clusters.
.Hierarchical: Use for small datasets or when a dendrogram is useful.

# KMeans Clustering
KMeans clustering is a partition-based clustering algorithm that groups data points into a pre-specified number of clusters by minimizing the variance within each cluster
Key characteristic: Clusters are non-hierarchical and do not have any inherent orderingHierarchical Clustering

# Hierarchical clustering:
 Hierarchical clustering is a tree-based (hierarchical) method of clustering that builds a hierarchy of clusters by either merging smaller clusters into larger ones (agglomerative) or splitting larger clusters into smaller ones (divisive).
Key characteristic: Clusters have a nested structure, showing relationships between groups at different levels.
